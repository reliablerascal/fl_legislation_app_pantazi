# Legislator Dashboard

This repo is forked from the Jacksonville Tributary's [legislator dashboard](https://github.com/apantazi/legislator_dashboard). I'm in the process of automating, streamlining, and documenting the existing data pipeline to facilitate long-term maintainability and scalability. My new work in progress is contained within two separate repos:
* [ETL Data Pipeline](https://github.com/reliablerascal/fl-legislation-app-postgres)- this revised data pipeline stores raw data from LegiScan's API, creates views, and creates an application layer to simplify access for the Shiny app and future application development. 
* [Shiny App](https://github.com/reliablerascal/fl-legislation-app-postgres)- this revised application retrieves data from the application layer
